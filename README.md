# VulScope: Enhanced Vulnerability Detection with Local Context Analysis and Code Similarity Verification

This repository contains the code and scripts for our research on **VulScope**, a method that augments existing vulnerability detection CLMs by leveraging Local Context Analysis(LCA) and Code Similarity Verification (CSV).

**We plan to finalize and release the complete codebase within two weeks.**  
Please stay tuned for further updates in this repository.
